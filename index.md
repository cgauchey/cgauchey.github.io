## About Me

I am currently a pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Columbia University with a focus on Machine Learning. Prior to Columbia, I worked at JPMorgan as a software engineer for three years in the Corporate & Investment Bank and New Product Development (AR/VR). I graduated from Barnard College in 2019 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Psychology. I am originally from San Francisco and currently reside in New York City. 

## About My Advisor

Dr. Lisa Soros is a Roman Family Teaching and Research Fellow in Computer Science at Barnard College. Her research interests focus on generative systems in virtual worlds, from evolutionary robotics to content generation in video games. She is specifically interested in applications of evolutionary algorithms to open-ended search. Since 2017, she has served on the Board of Directors for the International Society for Artificial Life, which promotes research on the simulation and synthesis of living systems.

## About My Project

This project is being done in collaboration with In-Chang Baek at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. His goal is to create an AI competition based on the game Overcooked! with the explicit goal of being able to measure communication between agents. In order to establish a baseline, we are developing general game playing agents using approaches such as cooperative Monte Carlo Tree Search. Future research will look at quantitative ways of measuring the relationship between agents and environments.
