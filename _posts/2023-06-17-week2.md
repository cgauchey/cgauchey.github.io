title: Week 2

We were finally all able to successfully set up our environments and run the code locally! We spent a majority of this week looking into different directions the project could head in. We considered altering Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), building the Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm (RHEA) and comparing it against MCTS, and researching neural networks as alternatives to UCT. We ultimately decided to begin by adapting an existing RHEA repository into the Overcooked! game environment. Most of this week was spent trying to understand RHEA and how it can be tested, as well as how we can integrate it into the code we already have. In the fall, I intend to continue looking into how we could augment MCTS with neural networks.
