title: Week 1

This week, I had a chance to learn more about each of the project Dr. Soros is working on in her lab. I also had a chance to meet the students who worked on Overcooked! last semester, as well as the students that will be working on it this summer. We spent most of week 1 working on transitioning the work over from the those who worked on it previously and setting up all the code locally. We also spent some time reviewing the code in addition to some relevant literature.
